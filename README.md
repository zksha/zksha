# ðŸ’–Hey! Nice to see you!
I'm Yiming Xiong, welcome to my page! 
## A bit about me
-ðŸŒ± I'm currently exploring and experimenting with different paths to build usable and reliable LLM applications for real-world industry use.
-ðŸ˜Ž I took a gap year to dive deep into LLM-powered social media analysis â€” acted as the core architect and developer for our next-gen research agent. Also worked on Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning using large-scale industrial datasets.
