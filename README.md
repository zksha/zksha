# 💖Hey! Nice to see you!
I am Yiming Xiong (熊一鸣), a Data Science Master's student at the University of British Columbia. Building on my professional experience as a Machine Learning Engineer at DataStory, I am now transitioning toward deeper research.

My interests lie in how knowledge, architectures, and even social structures can naturally be explored, balanced, and optimized within self-contained, ever-evolving agentic systems. I aim to study this area in Automated AI Research, exploring how agents can discover and optimize their own architectures and rules without human intervention.
